              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Once you've picked values
  for the 3 sliders and pushed the START button, a short program computes the
  fusion power that would be produced in your reactor. Your <em>score </em>depends
  not only on the amount of fusion power, but also how much <em>auxiliary power </em>you
  had to use.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Several people have
  asked what the score really means. Reactor designers focus on a quantity they
  call Q, defined as the fusion power divided by the sum of the <em>auxiliary </em>and
  ohmic heating power. The ohmic heating power is the resistive heat generated
  by the tokamak's toroidal current and amounts to a few megawatts in this case.
  The problem with Q is that it can be very large (say, 1000) near ignition.
  Yet, values of 1 (breakeven) or 5 (plasma heating by alpha particles =
  external heating power) are interesting. Reactor designs with Q = 10 have been
  considered. To convey this fact to the user without going through all of the
  above explanation, we came up with the &quot;score&quot; = 100 ( Q / 100) <sup>0.3</sup>,
  so that a score of 25 corresponds to Q = 1 and a score of 100 to Q = 100. Of
  course, scores greater than 100 are possible.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">The picture in the
  middle represents a cut-away view of our Virtual Tokamak so we can see the
  plasma inside. Just for fun, this plasma changes color with your <em>score </em>according
  to the color scale at the bottom. A real fusion plasma wouldn't do this; it
  would always appear to be a sort of pink or red color.</font></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">When the program is
  computing the fusion power for your reactor and your <em>score </em>, it also
  determines the <em>temperature </em>of the plasma. The <em>temperature </em>is
  just the way a scientist measures how fast the electrons and ions in the
  plasma are moving around.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">For comparison, the
  temperature in the <em>center </em>of the Sun is 15 million degrees Celsius!
  Tokamak plasma temperatures need to be hotter than those in the Sun since
  tokamak plasma densities are much lower than the Sun's.</font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">An easy way to do better is
  to change just one slider at a time in small steps. When you can't do better
  with that one, try then moving a second one in the same way.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Show the <em>Graph </em>or
                <em>Table </em>to keep track of how your previous tries have turned out.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">You probably guessed
  from the <em>slider </em>descriptions that you should be able to get a better
  score by just setting all of the sliders to their largest values. But that
  didn't happen, did it?</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">That's because the
  program has built-in limits on the <em>plasma density </em>and <em>temperature.
                </em>When you exceed one of the limits, you lose control of the plasma (fusion
  scientists say the plasma <em>disrupts </em>) and no fusion power is produced.
  The program returns a big fat zero for a score.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">The limiting density and
  temperature values vary with the magnetic field (among other things) in ways
  which have been determined by experience with actual tokamak experiments. Your
  highest scores will generally be obtained just below these limits. If you want
  to know more, try the exercises.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">One of the 3 sliders has
  a much bigger effect on the score than the other two. See if you can figure
  out which one and then use that knowledge to get a better score.</font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">The score is related to
  the amount of fusion power divided by the <em>auxiliary heating power </em>(which
  you set with the slider!). So, the best scores are actually made with a <em>low</em>
  auxiliary heating power.</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">The calculation used to
  compute the <em>score</em> for the Virtural Tokamak is really quite complex.
  In fact, fusion scientists actually use a full-fledged (with more adjustable
  controls) version when they want a quick idea of how well a tokamak reactor
  design would work.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">At the same time, this
  calculation is based on real fusion experiments. With these exercises, you can
  use the Virtual Tokamak to unearth that underlying fusion physics.</font>

                    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Keeping the magnetic
      field and auxiliary power the same, raise the plasma density in small
      steps until the plasma disrupts (a score of 0.00 is given). Make a note of
      the slider values for the highest density you reach before the disruption.</font>
                      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Change one of the

                        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Repeat this exercise
      until you understand how the maximum density depends on the values of the
      other two sliders.</font>
                          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Test your theory by
      estimating the maximum density for values of the magnetic field and
      auxiliary power which you haven't tried yet. Then, try them and see if
      your prediction was correct.</font>
                            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Be careful while
      you're doing this not to get to temperatures which are too high, otherwise
      the limit on the temperature will come into play, making it more difficult
      for you to single out the density limit. This is the way real physics
      works!</font></li>
                          </ol>
                          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">We'd like to tell you more
  about the density limit, but frankly we just don't really know what causes it!</font>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Having understood the
  density limit, you can examine temperature limit. Strictly speaking, it is a
  limit on the plasma pressure, which is the product of the plasma density and
  temperature. In practice, though, it's usually the temperature that increases
  too much, producing a plasma too hot for the magnetic field to confine in a
  stable manner.</font>
                          <ol>
                            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">At this limit, the
      ratio of the plasma pressure to the pressure of the magnetic field has a
      certain value which has been determined by experiments and theoretical
      calculations. The way the Virtual Tokamak is designed, this critical ratio
      is always the same.</font>
                              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">First, try to find a
      point where the plasma disrupts at this pressure limit. Hold the magnetic
      field and plasma density fixed and slowly raise the auxiliary heating
      power until you get a score = 0.00. Make a note of the density,
      temperature, and magnetic field for the auxiliary power value just below
      the pressure limit.</font>
                                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">How do you know this
      is not the density limit?</font>
                                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Now, repeat this
      exercise at one or two other values for the magnetic field. How did the
      maximum possible plasma pressure (density times temperature) change?</font>
                                    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">The relationship
      between the maximum plasma pressure and the magnetic field is complicated
      by the contribution to the plasma pressure made by the high energy helium
      nuclei which are produced by the fusion reactions. In this case, the
      pressure which is compared with the limiting value is significantly larger
      than you will compute just by multiplying the plasma density and
      temperature.</font></li>
                                  </ol>
                                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Low Temperature Limit. The
  defining characteristic of a tokamak is the toroidal plasma current, which
  along with the magnetic field produced by the external magnetic field coils
  provides the confining and stabilizing forces. As this current runs through
  the plasma, it generates heat just like electricity does when it runs through
  a circuit. In this exercise, we first set the auxiliary power slider to 0.00.</font>
                                  <ol>
                                    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Then, hold the
      magnetic field constant, and change the density in small steps. Make a
      note of the temperature values at each density. What happens to the
      temperature values as the density is raised?</font>
                                      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Now, do the same at a
      different magnetic field. Considering only the lowest densities you tried
      at each magnetic field, see if you can determine the relationship between
      the magnetic field and the temperature in this <em>ohmic </em>heating
      limit.</font>
                                        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif">Test your theory by
      first selecting another magnetic field, predicting the temperature (at low
      density), and then running the Virtual Tokamak to see he well you did.</font></li>
