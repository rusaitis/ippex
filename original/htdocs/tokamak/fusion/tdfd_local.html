<p>
As part of the <a HREF="http://ippex.pppl.gov/">Internet
Plasma Physics Education eXperience</a> (IPPEX) project, this 
<a HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/">Java</a>
applet is designed to illustrate the basic principles of magnetically
confined fusion.
<p>
Anxious to get started? You can adjust the waveforms of the three
input variables by clicking &quot;Details&quot; for each. This will
show a window that allows you to edit the intensity of each input
variable over time.
The sliders in the main window allow you to multiply your waveform by
a certain factor.
<p>
For example, setting auxiliary power to 75
from 50 would scale all the values by 3/2. Look at the axes for
changing numbers. When you're ready to test out your values, click
&quot;START&quot; and watch the output by clicking &quot;Output
Graph.&quot; While the output graph is scrolling with data, the color
of the plasma in the main window will change too in accordance to the
score. You can repeat the process as much as you like. Please e-mail 
<a href="mailto:dstotler@pppl.gov">Daren Stotler</a> with comments and 
feedback. Also feel free to e-mail 
<a href="mailto:wfisher@gmail.com">Will Fisher</a> just for fun.

<p>
<strong>NOTE: </strong>This applet requires Java version 1.4.2 
or later to
run. If the applet does not appear, you likely have an inadequate
version of Java.
You can download the latest
version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from the 
<a href="http://www.java.com">Java Web site</a> (click the 
&quot;Get It Now&quot; button).  You can get the specific version
used during code development
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">here</a>
(click on &quot;Download J2SE JRE&quot;). If you are still having difficulty 
running the applet, try
the original version of the <a HREF="http://ippex.pppl.gov/temp/tokamak/tokamaknew.htm">Virtual Tokamak</a>.&nbsp;

Kinda' makes you wonder what I did! I've got a
