<p>To the members of the Nebraska AAPT:</p>
<p>Here is what I promised you.&nbsp; All are in PDF format.&nbsp; The first is
my <a href="Nebraska%20AAPT.pdf">talk</a> (45 MB).&nbsp; The second is an <a href="Gershman%20Invited.pdf">invited
talk</a> (16 MB) at the American Physical Society's Division of Plasma Physics
meeting by Sophia Gershman of Watchung Hills Regional High School.&nbsp; She
discusses ways she weaves plasmas into her introductory curricula.&nbsp; The
next is a <a href="high%20speed%20plasma%20video.pdf">paper</a> (36 MB) written
by a summer student on high speed video imaging of various plasma sources.
Finally, there is a <a href="Trace_movie_2.mov">movie</a> (14 MB) of magnetic
confinement of hot ions at the surface of the sun.&nbsp; You'll need QuickTime
to view it.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Father Michael and Tom Brestel for their help and to Brent for
the invitation.&nbsp; I had a wonderful day.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Andrew Post-Zwicker</p>
