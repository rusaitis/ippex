<P>The Plasma Science and Fusion Energy Institute is a two-week intensive
workshop designed to provide the opportunity to study plasma physics and
fusion energy through experimental research in our state-of-the-art laboratories.
Participants will perform experiments, in collaboration with laboratory
scientists, that investigate the basic properties of plasmas. Finally, plasmas are
 ideal to illustrate
many concepts in high school physics curricula including waves, atoms, nuclear
reactions, relativity, electricity and magnetism. An integral part of the
Institute will be the development of new plasma-based lesson plans, student-led
investigations and demonstrations.</P>

<P><B>Eligibility and Selection</B></P>

<P>Current physics teachers of grades 9-12 are eligible to apply. Selection
is limited to 12 and is based, in part, on the applicant's teaching, research,
and educational experience. Applications from those with experience in laboratory
research and creation of new and innovative curricula are especially encouraged.</P>

<P><B>Stipend</B></P>

<P>Participants will receive a stipend of $600 upon completion of the Institute.
Expenses for travel to and from the university and housing
will be covered.  Commuters will be considered but
on-site housing is encouraged.</P>
